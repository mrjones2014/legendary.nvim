If you have [Stylua](https://github.com/johnnymorganz/stylua) and [Luacheck](https://github.com/mpeterv/luacheck)
installed, you can run the checks locally by running `make check`. This will run the linter, the style checker,
and all unit tests. Make sure to follow the code style found in the existing code.
