TABLE STRUCTURES                                  *legendary-table-structures*


The tables for keymaps, commands, and `augroup`/`autocmd`s are all similar.

Descriptions can be specified either in the top-level `description` property
on each table, or inside the `opts` table as `opts.desc = 'Description goes
here'`.

For `autocmd`s, you must include a `description` property for it to appear in
the finder. This is a design decision because keymaps and commands are
frequently executed manually, so they should appear in the finder by default,
while executing `autocmd`s manually with `:doautocmd` is a much less common
use-case, so `autocmd`s are hidden from the finder unless a description is
provided.

You can also run `:LegendaryApi`, then search for `/legendary.types` to read
the full API documentation on accepted types.
